arenas:
  # The modality on which the arenas run. Can be either 'local' or 'bungee'.
  # - local:
  #   Should be used when you have one server that handles both lobby and arenas.
  #   Using this modality permits you to create auto-updatable signs that can be clicked by players
  #   to join the arenas.
  # - bungee:
  #   Should be used when you have a BungeeCord based network, with - for
  #   example - a server used just for lobby and one server for every arena.
  #   Using this modality will make players auto-join the configured arena when
  #   they join the arena's server and they'll be teleported back to the lobby server
  #   as soon as the game ends.
  mode: 'local'

  # *** LOCAL ONLY ***

  # The location of the lobby (or hub), the place where players are teleported when the game ends.
  # Usually this is also the place where you put join signs.
  # TODO: make it configurable in-game through a command.
  hub-location: {
    world: world,
    x: 0,
    y: 100,
    z: 0,
    pitch: 0, # The head rotation on the Y axis.
    yaw: 0    # The head rotation on the XZ axes.
  }

  # *** BUNGEE ONLY ***

  # This is the name of the arena that is automatically joined when the players join the server.
  main-arena: 'my-arena'

  # This is the server where players go back when the game ends (aka the lobby-server or hub-server).
  # The name of the server, must be the same present in the BungeeCord configuration.
  hub-server: 'quake-lobby'

# A spigot bug re-clicks a slot twice if there is too much lag, this behaviour might cause the
# lobby-leave hotbar button to press instantly after joining. This is a cooldown that prevents
# the player from leaving the lobby before x milliseconds after joining.
