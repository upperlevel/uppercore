## What is Uppercore?
Uppercore is a set of APIs, above Bukkit and Spigot ones, that provides a dev-friendly development to the user.

Bare Spigot lacks of many features, just think about the poor command system, scoreboards, configs, GUIs.
Most of the times the developer is forced to fulfill these lacks by copy-pasting its own wrappers.

Well, Uppercore avoids that by including all the needs!

## How to build?

To build the library:

`gradle clean shadowJar`

To build the integration-test:

`gradle clean testJar`
